This is an example fun usage of Speechify API.
I am pursuing a minor in acting, and I have been in many shows throughout my highschool and college carreer.
Often it is really helpful to run lines with someone, but sometimes there is no one around.
This program allows you to upload a script, choose a character, and then practice your lines while you listen to your cue lines read to you.
You will need to put in your own Speechify API key into your cloned repository.
I have included a sample script from Monty Python, but you can use your own if you like, but the delimiter parser only works in the format of character name followed by a colon followed by the dialouge.
